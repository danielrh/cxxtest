This directory will contain cxxtest v4. Files that are needed will be 
slowly propagated to here from the v3 branch. I am not 100% sure what 
the directory structure should be.

tigris basically requires us to have a www directory directly under 
trunk. So I probably want a directory to contain everything inside of 
trunk in order to have a clear seperation between the website and the 
code.

Something like:

branches
  v3
    ...
tags
  v3.10.1
    ...
trunk
  www
  cxxtest
    include
    src
    test
    doc
    ...

Although that feels a bit too deep, but not horrible
