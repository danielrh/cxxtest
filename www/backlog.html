<title> CxxTest development backlog</title>
</head>
<body>

This is intended to be a listing of desired features in rough priority
order. Ideally they should be broken down into small chunks (a day or two of
work at most).

<ul>
<li> Import the current code into svn.
<li> Go through the SF bug reports and import the ones we expect to address into tigris.
<li> Go through the SF forums and import the issues we expect to address into tigris.
<li> Get the web pages set up on tigris
<li> Put the cxxtest user manual into svn .. im not sure what format to go with?
<li> Insert our own ideas into the issue tracker
<li> Shorten the assertion names: ASSERT_EQ, ASSERT_NE, ASSERT_LT, ASSERT_LE, etc. (better than TS_ASSERT_LESS_THAN_OR_EQUALS); could leave original TS_* untouched, could make the new ones TS_ASSERT_EQ or even drop the TS altogether? 
<li> Could add greater-than asserts, but that could make the printer objects larger? 
<li> Also, make TS_ASSERT_SAME_DATA able to handle wider word widths; currently the output compares byte-wise, and prints byte-wise, which is a bit awkward on little-endian machines
<li> Could add a fatal/non-fatal assertion: ASSERT_EQ vs EXPECT_EQ... not sure if this is possible without exceptions tho...
* I think this syntax is really cool: TS_ASSERT(val, val) &lt;&lt; "Failed in iteration " &lt;&lt; i;
<li> Improve the unit tests for CxxTest itself (currently the test runner is a perl script, and the tests are not well documented). Need to make the unit tests easily compilable by anyone who wants to use them, so they can verify CxxTest on their compiler/platform.
<li> Implement additional Printers (e.g., a colorized printer, printers that have more structured output [ not just 'Running 1 tests...OK!' ])
<li> Add timing, if desired; for example, report how long each test took to run (or the whole suite)
<li> Test (fix bugs) with most recent compilers.
<li> Improve function mock's. I think
  that <a href="http://www.lastcraft.com/cgreen.php">cgreen</a> could be a
  good model here.
</ul>
